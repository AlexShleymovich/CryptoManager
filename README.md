# Alex Crypto Manager

## Description 
This project represents the culmination of my ITSafe Academy Python course, showcasing my expertise in developing a desktop application that enables users to track their crypto assets.

## Technology Stack
The application was built using the eel Python module (see app_main.py), which provides a powerful and easy-to-use interface for creating desktop applications. All the necessary information and calculations for the tickers, prices, and historical data were obtained using APIs (see class_crypto.py).

For the front-end side, the MetroUI framework was utilized, along with plain JS and jQuery to create a seamless and intuitive user experience.
